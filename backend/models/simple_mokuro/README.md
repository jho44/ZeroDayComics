# Goal

Input: list of file objects
Output: Pass text and box coords to frontend
frontend will then render the img File and put the text and box coords in the right places
while also putting click handlers on each box
when click on box, want to then copy that box's contents into the translation pane

_server doesn't handle such frontend details_
